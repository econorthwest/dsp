# Developer Supply Preprocessor (DSP)

DSP is a pro forma-based real estate development forecasting model that identifies the "highest and best uses" of tax lots, including those with identified potential redevelopment opportunities. It works in two stages:

1. Estimate the feasible "highest and best uses" (if any) of the land and real estate.
2. Use a "redevelopment probability screen" to estimate the likelihood the tax lot will redevelop and calculate expected yields of square footage and units built.
